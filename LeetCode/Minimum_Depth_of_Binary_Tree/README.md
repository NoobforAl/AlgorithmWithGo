## Description Question

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:

```txt
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
