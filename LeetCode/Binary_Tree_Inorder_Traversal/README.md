## Description Question

Given the root of a binary tree, return the (in order) traversal of its nodes' values.

Example 1:

```txt
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```txt
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
