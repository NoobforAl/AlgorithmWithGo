## Description Question

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

height-balanced:A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Example 1:

```txt
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```txt
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104
